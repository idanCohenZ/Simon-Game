# Simon-Game
A Simon game fully built with Jquery and Javascript. a cool game and exercise
Have a play around with the game and look at the code. If you are unaware of the game rules:
The screen will present you in each stage the next button to press- your job is to remember all the buttons and the order in which you should press them. Sounds easy?
Have a game and see for yourself if it really is...
